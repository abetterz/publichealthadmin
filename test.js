      "Deaths among people aged 18 to 49 increased more than 40 percent in the 12 months ending October 2021 compared to the same period in 2018–2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of death certificate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by The Epoch Times.  The agency doesn’t yet have full 2021 numbers, as death certificate data trickles in with a lag of one to eight weeks or more.  The increase was notable across the country and in no state was COVID reported in more than 60 percent of the excess deaths. Some states experienced much steeper hikes than others.  Nevada was the worst with a 65 percent prime-age mortality surge of which only 36 percent was attributed to COVID. Texas was second with a 61 percent jump of which 58 percent was attributed to COVID. Arizona and Tennessee recorded 57 percent increases with 37 percent and 33 percent attributed to COVID respectively. Not far behind was California at 55 percent and 42 percent attributed to COVID as well as New Mexico (52 percent, 33 percent), Florida (51 percent, 48 percent), and Louisiana (51 percent, 32 percent).",

      "Covid-19 vaccine mandate struck down for San Diego schools DATED: DECEMBER 29, 2021 BY SHARYL ATTKISSON LEAVE A COMMENT   An Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) funded lawsuit has struck down the Covid-19 vaccine mandate to attend school in San Diego, California.   This is the first COVID-19 vaccine requirement in the country to be struck down in a final ruling.  Aaron Siri, ICAN's lead attorney, and his team filed the lawsuit funded by ICAN on behalf of a parent whose child was being forced to receive the Covid-19 vaccine to continue school.  This ICAN lawsuit, S.V. on behalf of J.D. vs San Diego Unified School District, was consolidated with a lawsuit filed by Let Them Choose.  Both plaintiffs moved for a final decision from the court asking it to find that the Covid-19 vaccine mandate for students was illegal.  On Dec 20, the judge ruled it was illegal on the basis that school boards in California do not have the authority to require a Covid-19 vaccine.  A copy of tentative decision can be read here or for more information about ICAN you can visit their website here.  Additionally, my latest Full Measure After Hours podcast features an in-depth interview with attorney Aaron Siri about vaccine mandates in the court system. Listen here.

      'Washington Post blasts Sotomayor for ‘false’ COVID claim that ‘over 100K’ children are in \'serious condition’ The newspaper gave Sotomayor \'four Pinocchios\' for her \'absurdly high\' figure Talia KaplanBy Talia Kaplan | Fox News Facebook   Twitter   Flipboard   Comments   Print   Email  CDC director corrects Justice Soto mayor on mischaracterization of pediatric hospitalizations CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky joined \'Fox News Sunday\' to discuss the latest on pediatric hospitalizations, arguing the number of children\'s cases of COVID-19 is fewer than 3,500.  The Washington Post called out Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Saturday over her "false" claim that more than 100,000 children are "in serious condition," many of them on ventilators, because of COVID-19.   The Washington Post performed what they call "The Pinocchio Test" and gave Sotomayor "four Pinocchios" for her "absurdly high" figure, arguing that "it’s important for Supreme Court justices to make rulings based on correct data."   A spokesperson with the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.   placeholder Sotomayor came under withering criticism Friday after she falsely suggested that upwards of 100,000 children in the United States are hospitalized from COVID-19.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP) (Photo by Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)  Sotomayor drastically overstated the number of young people who have fallen severely ill from coronavirus during oral arguments on the Biden administration\'s mandate on private businesses for employees to be either vaccinated or frequently tested.   "We have hospitals that are almost at full capacity with people severely ill on ventilators. We have over 100,000 children, which we\'ve never had before, in serious condition, many on ventilators," she said.  The Washington Post slammed Sotomayor’s claim as "wildly incorrect, assuming she is referring to hospitalizations, given the reference to ventilators."   The newspaper pointed to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which showed that as of Jan. 8 there were about 5,000 children hospitalized in a pediatric bed, either with suspected COVID or a confirmed laboratory test and noted that the figure includes patients in observation beds.

(Photo by Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images)  "So Sotomayor’s number is at least 20 times higher than reality, even before you determine how many are in ‘serious condition,’" The Washington Post said. Referencing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the newspaper also noted that there have been about 83,000 hospital admissions of children confirmed with COVID since Aug. 1, 2020, while pointing out that there are more children hospitalized now than at any point during the pandemic.  placeholder Speaking with "Fox News Sunday," CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted that currently the number of pediatric hospitalizations due to COVID-19 is less than 3,500.  "While pediatric hospitalizations are rising, they are still about 15-fold less that hospitalizations of our older age demographics," Walensky said on Sunday.    As with prior strains of the virus, younger people are at far less risk than the elderly of severe outcomes from the coronavirus.  The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday in a high-stakes public session to decide whether the U.S. government can begin enforcing sweeping COVID-19 vaccine requirements affecting nearly 100 million workers.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) For nearly four hours, the justices heard oral arguments over federal vaccine and testing rules or businesses with 100 employees or more and on vaccine mandates for health care workers at facilities receiving Medicaid and Medicare funding.   Enforcement of the policies, which were announced in November, has been put on hold pending resolution in the high court.   Sotomayor was nominated by President Obama and has been on the Supreme Court since 2009.  placeholder CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Fox News’ David Rutz, Brooke Singman and Bill Mears contributed to this report.
